Following on from my previous post about configuring <a href="http://ymmit.net/2016/11/15/configure-tps-with-vra/" target="_blank">TPS settings for VMs</a> as a Day 2 Action in vRA, I thought it would be cool if you could request a report template for a VM that you have access to in vRA. This could be storage, compute, network or an availability report, as long as your report template in vROPS is configured to run against a VM object this should work fine.

The basic funtions of this Workflow is asÂ follows:
<ol>
	<li>Get vROPS Resource ID for the VM</li>
	<li>Set the Report ID of the selected vROPS report</li>
	<li>Take input from the user if the report should be re-occurring or just a once off</li>
	<li>Submit the configuration to vROPS along with the email of the user who requested it.</li>
</ol>
The first thing to do is to setup your HTTP REST targets in vRO, one thing I did find with this is that the default Invoke-REST Operation will return a XML response from vROPS which isn't fun to work with in vRO. You need to add in an additional HTTP Header (Accept = application/JSON) so you get a JSON response and parsing this to get the info you require is much easier. So you can clone the current Invoke-REST Operation, add this line &lt;insert line&gt; and reuse it whenever you make REST calls to vROPS in the future.

If you use Postman, fire it up and have a look in the API to get familiar, I found this pre-configured Postman library for vROPS here.
