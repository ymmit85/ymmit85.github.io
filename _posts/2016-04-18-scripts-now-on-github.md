I've recently started moving my scripts over to <a href="https://github.com/ymmit85">GitHub</a>. Seeing that I still like to use a GUI I've installed <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>Â on my PCs so I can access them easially and save to a single location along with the other features of GitHub such as comparing different commits.

I won't do a blog post for all of them, only ones I think are cool or pretty handy, the rest I'll just upload, also some are just copies of what other people have created and I may have modified for my own use case.
